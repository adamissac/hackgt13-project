# PROGRESS

## 2026-09-26 03:38 UTC | alan | Claude Code (cloud session)
**Task:** Kit unblock: add MASTER_SPEC.md (pre-AL1)
**Status:** done
**What I did:**
- Added `MASTER_SPEC.md` at the repo root, converted from the team's spec PDF (text extraction; some tables lost alignment, the PDF is the original).
- Agent work for Alan lives on branch `claude/quirky-euler-dnbsgt` (merge into main when ready).
**How to run/test it:** `less MASTER_SPEC.md` (Section 13 = build order, Section 6 = ML spec).
**Next step for whoever continues:** Start AL1: create `ml/app/main.py` (FastAPI + `/health`), `ml/app/auth.py` (Supabase JWT via PyJWT), `ml/app/db.py` (psycopg pool).
**Known issues / blockers:** Supabase project ref still unset in `.mcp.json` (Adam).
**Contract changes:** none

**Task:** Kit install (pre-AD1)
**Status:** blocked
**What I did:**
- Moved the Claude kit to repo root; added the hidden kit files that were missing from the first push (`.claude/`, `.mcp.json`, `.githooks/`).
- Started this PROGRESS.md.
**How to run/test it:** `./scripts/claude-setup.sh <your name>`, then `claude "$(cat prompts/<your name>.md)"`
**Next step for whoever continues:** Add `MASTER_SPEC.md` to the repo root (it's referenced everywhere but isn't in the repo or on Adam's Mac). Put the Supabase project ref in `.mcp.json` in place of `YOUR_PROJECT_REF`. Then start AD1 (`supabase init` in `supabase/`).
**Known issues / blockers:** MASTER_SPEC.md missing; Supabase project ref not set; claude-setup.sh not yet run on Adam's laptop.
**Contract changes:** none
